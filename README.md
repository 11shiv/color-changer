# Color Changer Project

This project demonstrates how to change the background color of a webpage by clicking buttons. The webpage uses **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript** to achieve this effect. Each button corresponds to a color, and when you click on a button, the background color of the page changes to match the color of that button.
